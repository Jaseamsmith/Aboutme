     <h3> Biography 👓 </h3>
     <p> This past summer, I did an internship with a program called Futures and Options. Through their internship i was placed at a film company called Black and Latinos Filmmaker Coalition. My role at the production company was the production assistant. I organized casting for a film we were working on, location scouted and even produced my own film alongside the other interns. It was such a fun process being that i had prior experience with film equipment and a film crew, that i was able to enjoy the process than stress over it. I even published it to my youtube channel and we are almost at eight hundred views and im super exited! Also i attended a workshop once each week and i learned about loans and other finiacial things i would need to know about for my future.</p>
     
     <p> Honestly im a very open book and i love meeting new people. I like to surround myself with intellignet individals who wanna own their own buisness and have high hopes for their future. My favorite color is blue and its really ironic being that my birthstone is sapphire. I even have a my own youtube channel where i do challenges or clogs and i just love being infront over the camera when im in control. When someonelse is behing the camera i become super camera shy even though i wanna be a model. Im nott sure what career i wanna have as an adult but i for sure wanna own my own buisness and be the man in the charge. </p>

     <h3> Technology 📱 </h3>
     <p> I use my computer, my phone and my Ipad. I mainly use my phone on the daily for socila media, snapchat and even video games. My comuter i use every other day for listening to music or doing homework, i even download music illegally but dont tell anyone lol. My Ipad i use it when im traveling and dont wanna cary my laptop or if my phone is dying. That pretty muchh sums it up.</p>
